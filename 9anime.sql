Hellbent on defiance, Tanya resolves to ascend the ranks of her country\'s military as it slowly plunges into world war, with only Being X proving to be the strongest obstacle in recreating the peaceful life she once knew. But her perceptive actions and combat initiative have an unintended side effect: propelling the mighty Empire into becoming one of the most powerful nations in mankind\'s history.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In 2013 of modern-era Tokyo, an unnamed atheist Japanese salaryman, in the moment of being murdered by a disgruntled subordinate whom he had fired due to poor performance at work, is confronted by an entity that declares itself to be God who condemns the salaryman for not having \'faith\'. The salaryman disbelieves in its existence, criticises its various statements from his perspective as an atheist and mockingly terms it as \'Being X\'. The entity decides to reincarnate the salaryman into a world where he would face sufficiently difficult circumstances to turn to Being X for help. The salaryman is reborn as Tanya Degurechaff, an orphaned girl in an alternate reality\'s equivalent of Imperial Germany, known as the Empire, in which World War I has been delayed until the 1920s and where magic has been incorporated into the military. According to Being X, if Tanya either does not die a natural death or refuses to have faith in it, her soul will leave the cycle of reincarnation and will be sent to hell for the countless sins that Tanya has committed in her previous life. In search for an escape, Tanya decides to join the Empire\'s Mage Corps and fight in the war, hoping to reach a high enough rank as fast as possible to remain far from the battlefield, and in this way avoid the risk of being killed. Even if she\'s now forced to speak with a young girl\'s lips, Tanya soon turns into a ruthless soldier who prioritizes efficiency and her own career over anything else, even the lives of those beneath her, especially those that get on her bad side.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><b>Characters</b></span></span></p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Tanya Degurechaff</span><br></td><td style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><b><i>Tanya</i></b> is a young blonde, blue-eyed girl who is the reincarnation of a cold-hearted, atheistic, and social-darwinistic Japanese salaryman (briefly voiced by Kōsuke Toriumi in Japanese, and Josh Grelle in English). She is a mage with magical powers that enable her to fly and fire explosive bullets from guns. Compared to others, Tanya has a high latent magical ability and is the only one capable of using an experimental Type-95 operation orb due to Being X\'s interference. She controls a battalion of elite mages whose main purpose is to overwhelm enemy forces while also remaining highly mobile and relatively small. Tanya is quite ruthless and intolerant of failings in others, much the same as in her previous life, and employs several extreme punishments and training methods. After she graduated from War College as one of the Twelve Knights, she was granted the title of von. By the end of TV series her rank is major. At the end of the movie, she finally gets her dream job working with an office job in the rear for 2 months with a promotion to lieutenant colonel, much to her joy and triumphs against her hated enemy, Being X. But that joy was short-lived when she received a phone call from General Zettour, who informed her that he had put her proposal, titled \"Unit Usage and Operational Maneuvers in the Current War\" to use and organized a Kampfgruppe codenamed \"Salamander\", which consisted of infantry, armor, and artillery, gave her command of the special army and wanted to see her research in action by having her and the 203rd mage battalion return to the front lines once more, much to her shock and horror.</span><br></td></tr><tr><td><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Viktoriya Ivanovna</span><br></td><td style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><b><i>Viktoriya </i></b>is a Second Lieutenant in the Imperial Army and serves under <b><i>Tanya Degurechaff</i></b>, and later becomes her adjutant.

(2, 'Attack on Titan', 'The Titans attack Wall Maria', 1, '<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Plot</span></b></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin, lit. \'The Advancing Giant\') is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. It is set in a world where humanity is forced to live in cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect them from gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans; the story follows Eren Yeager, who vows to exterminate the Titans after they bring about the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother. Attack on Titan was serialized in Kodansha\'s monthly shōnen manga magazine Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from September 2009 to April 2021, with its chapters collected in 34 tankōbon volumes. An anime television series was produced by Wit Studio (seasons 1–3) and MAPPA (season 4). A 25-episode first season was broadcast from April to September 2013, followed by a 12-episode second season broadcast from April to June 2017. A 22-episode third season was broadcast in two parts, with the first 12 episodes airing from July to October 2018 and the last 10 episodes airing from April to July 2019. A fourth and final season premiered in December 2020, airing 16 episodes in its first part. A second part consisting of 12 episodes aired from January to April 2022, and a third and final part will air in two halves; the first half will premiere in March 2023. Attack on Titan has become a critical and commercial success. As of September 2022, the manga has over 110 million tankōbon copies in print worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. It has won several awards, including the Kodansha Manga Award, the Attilio Micheluzzi Award, and the Harvey Award.</p><hr style=\"text-align: justify;\"><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b><i>The story of Attack on Titan centers on a civilization inside three circular walls.</i></b> According to the knowledge propagated locally, it is the last surviving vestige of human civilization. Its inhabitants, known as <font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">Eldians</font>, have been led to believe that over one hundred years ago, humanity was driven to the brink of extinction after the emergence of humanoid giants called Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight. The last remnants of humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed roughly a century of peace. Within the walls, the thought of venturing outside is strongly frowned upon and discouraged. To combat Titans, the country\'s military employs Vertical Maneuvering Equipment (VME), also called Omni-Directional Maneuvering Gear (ODM Gear): a set of waist-mounted grappling hooks and gas-powered propulsion enabling immense mobility in three dimensions. Swords made of ultrahard steel are used in conjunction with the gear, and eventually rocket launcher-like weapons called Thunder Spears are also developed. There exist different types of Titans. Pure Titans are the weakest and most generic Titans, whose behavior is easy to predict, making them easy to kill. Abnormal Titans are Pure Titans whose behavior is more difficult to predict, making them far more dangerous. <b>The Nine Titans</b>, also known as Titan Shifters (<b>Attack, Colossal, Armored, Female, Beast, Jaw, Cart, War Hammer, and Founding</b>), are the strongest Titans; each is able to shift back and forth between human and Titan form to access their Titan\'s abilities. Many Titan Shifters also possess the ability to harden certain parts of their bodies at will, typically in order to make them virtually impenetrable, or to strengthen their blows during combat. Pure Titans are created by injecting Eldians with Pure Titan spinal fluid. If a Pure Titan eats the human body of a person who possesses one of the Nine Titans, said Eldian will revert to human form and gain that Shifter\'s powers, whereupon they are cursed to live only 13 more years. If their powers are not inherited by another Eldian before their death, their powers will be inherited by an Eldian baby born shortly thereafter, regardless of distance or blood-relations. As the story progresses, the true nature of the Titans and the existence of civilization outside the walls is revealed to the characters and the audience.<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b><u>Synopsis</u></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eren Yeager is a boy who lives in the town of Shiganshina, located on the outermost of three circular walls protecting their inhabitants from Titans. In the year 845, the first wall (Wall Maria) is breached by two new types of Titans, the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan. During the incident, Eren\'s mother is eaten by a Smiling Titan while Eren escapes. He swears revenge on all Titans and enlists in the military along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his best friend Armin Arlert. Five years after Shiganshina\'s fall, the Colossal Titan attacks the city of Trost, located on the second innermost wall (Wall Rose). Eren helps to successfully defend the city after he discovers a mysterious ability to turn himself into a sentient Attack Titan. Additionally, he regains memories of his father giving him this ability shortly after the fall of Wall Maria, and telling him that the truth about their world can be found in their basement in Shiganshina. These events draw the attention of the Survey Corps and their commander, Erwin Smith, who intend to use his power to reclaim Wall Maria and reach the Yeagers\' basement. Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are transferred to the Special Operations Squad, under the care of Captain Levi Ackerman and Hange Zoë. During an expedition into the forest between the walls, Eren and his companions encounter a sentient Female Titan, whom they later expose as their fellow military comrade Annie Leonhart. With help from his friends, Eren fights and defeats Annie, who encases herself in crystal and is put in custody. After the fight, it is discovered that there are Titans lying dormant within the walls (known as Wall Titans). Shortly thereafter, Pure Titans mysteriously appear within Wall Rose with no evidence of how they got in, accompanied by the sentient Beast Titan. Ymir, one of the new Survey Corps graduates, reveals that she can also transform into the sentient Jaw Titan, while Ymir\'s close friend Krista Lenz reveals herself as Historia Reiss, a member of the royal family. Two other members of the Survey Corps, Reiner Braun and Bertholt Hoover, reveal themselves as the Armored and Colossal Titan respectively. They attempt to kidnap Eren and Ymir, but fail. In the ensuing battle, Eren discovers another power within himself called \"the Coordinate\", that allows him to control other Titans, which he uses to kill the Smiling Titan and send a horde of Pure Titans to attack Reiner and Bertholt. This forces the two to escape, whereupon Ymir willingly flees with them, offering herself as sacrifice to prevent Historia from being targeted by the enemy. In the aftermath of these events, it is determined that the Pure Titans who suddenly appeared within Wall Rose were the inhabitants of various villages within Wall Rose, who had in some way been transformed into Titans. This leads the characters to the conclusion that all Pure Titans are, in fact, transformed human beings. Eren and his friends join Levi Squad while the Survey Corps is targeted by the Military Police led by Kenny Ackerman, Levi\'s uncle. In the occasion, they discover that by transforming into a Pure Titan via a serum made of spinal fluid and eating another Titan shifter, a person can gain its abilities, and that Historia and her father, Rod Reiss, are the only surviving members of the royal bloodline. Rod kidnaps Eren because he is in possession of the Founding Titan, obtained by his father Grisha upon eating Frieda Reiss (Historia\'s half-sister), and by Eren through eating his father. Rod transforms into a monstrous Abnormal Titan, but is killed by Historia (with the help of the Survey Corps), who is thereafter declared Queen. Having resolved the political unrest, the Survey Corps lead a successful operation to recapture Shiganshina, fighting the Beast, Colossal, Armored, and Cart Titans but suffering massive casualties, wherein Erwin dies in a suicide run against the Beast Titan, and Armin gains ownership of the Colossal Titan when Levi injects him with a serum given by Kenny, causing Armin to eat Bertholt. Eren and his companions return to his childhood home, where they discover the truth of their world: they are actually Eldians, sworn enemies of the conquering Marleyans who were enclosed within the walls after the original King Karl Fritz fled from the war. They are not the last humans as they were told, but rather an enclosed sect of Eldians on an isolated island called Paradis. Because they are \"Subjects of Ymir\" who can be turned into Titans by being injected with Titan spinal fluid, the Eldians continue to be oppressed by Marley. In the year after the battle of Shiganshina, the Survey Corps kill all of the remaining Pure Titans on the island. A map of the world of Attack on Titan, which resembles our own world flipped over the x-axis. Three years later, the Survey Corps attack Marley\'s capital, Liberio, orchestrated by Eren and his half-brother Zeke, who is the owner of the Beast Titan. Eren kills Willy Tybur, an Eldian who (along with his family) had been controlling Marley from the shadows and gains ownership of the War Hammer Titan after eating its previous owner, Willy\'s sister Lara. However, Eren is imprisoned for acting against orders but escapes with a faction of extremist Paradis soldiers called the Yeagerists. Zeke is kept in Levi\'s custody but manages to escape, severely injuring but not killing him. Marley\'s air fleet, led by Reiner, launch an invasion of Paradis, and chaos breaks out in the ensuing battle. Eren and Zeke reunite, which leads them to the Paths—a series of gateways connecting all Eldians through time and space. There, they meet the consciousness of Ymir Fritz—the original Titan—whose tortured past led to her imprisonment within the Paths for thousands of years. Zeke attempts to convince Ymir to fulfill his wish to stop the Subjects of Ymir from reproducing via mass sterilization.[a] However, Eren convinces Ymir to use her power to bring about the Rumbling—unleashing thousands of Wall Titans kept within Paradis\' walls and leading them on a genocidal march to kill everyone outside the island. The Survey Corps ally with remaining Marley forces, including Reiner and a now-freed Annie to stop Eren, and they defeat the Yeagerists before confronting Eren. After Levi kills Zeke and a mysterious creature that is the source of all Titans\' powers, Mikasa kills Eren, causing the power of the Titans vanish, reverting all Titans to human form, and stripping the Titan Shifters of their powers, thereby freeing all Eldians from the curse. His death also releases memory blocks that he put on his friends, revealing that what transpired was part of Eren\'s plan to spare twenty percent of humanity, with Armin, Levi, Mikasa, and the others being recognized as heroes in the eyes of the world for killing him and stopping the Rumbling. Three years later, as Paradis and the rest of the world rebuilds, Armin and his allies begin peace negotiations led by Queen Historia. Mikasa buries Eren underneath a tree on a hill near Shiganshina District.[b] The tree grows over time to resemble the one where the organism that granted Ymir her Titan power lived. An unspecified amount of time after Mikasa\'s death from old age, a modernized Shiganshina is reduced to rubble in a war. The series ends with a boy and a dog approaching the tree, which has become surrounded by wilderness, indicating that the Titans may return.<br></p><p><br></p>', 'the-titans-attack-wall-maria', '9anime-1674558562.png', '2023-01-24 08:09:22', '2023-01-24 08:09:22'),

With the NerveGear, a helmet that stimulates the user\'s five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. Both the game and the NerveGear were created by Akihiko Kayaba. On November 6, 10,000 players log into SAO\'s mainframe cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out. Kayaba appears and tells the players that they must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting of SAO if they wish to be free. He also states that those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear out-of-game will suffer real-life deaths.&nbsp; </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">A player named Kazuto \"Kirito\" Kirigaya is one of 1,000 testers in the game\'s previous closed beta. With the advantage of previous VR gaming experience and a drive to protect other beta testers from discrimination, he isolates himself from the greater groups and plays the game alone, bearing the mantle of \"beater\", a portmanteau of \"beta tester\" and \"cheater\". As the players progress through the game Kirito eventually befriends a young girl named Asuna Yuuki, forming a relationship with and later marrying her in-game. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba\'s secret ID, who was playing as \"Heathcliff\", the leader of the guild Asuna joined in, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game.&nbsp; </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In the real world, Kazuto discovers that 300 SAO players, including Asuna, remain trapped in their NerveGear. As he goes to the hospital to see Asuna, he meets Asuna\'s father Shouzou Yuuki who is asked by an associate of his, Nobuyuki Sugou, to make a decision, which Sugou later reveals to be his marriage with Asuna, angering Kazuto. Several months later, he is informed by Agil, another SAO survivor, that a figure similar to Asuna was spotted on \"The World Tree\" in another VRMMORPG cyberspace called Alfheim Online (ALO). Assi</span><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">sted in-game by his cousin Suguha \"Leafa\" Kirigaya and Yui, a navigation pixie (originally an AI from SAO), he quickly learns that the trapped players in ALO are part of a plan conceived by Sugou to perform illegal experiments on their minds. The goal is to create the perfect mind-control for financial gain and to subjugate Asuna, whom he intends to marry in the real world, to assume control of her family\'s corporation. Kirito eventually stops the experiment and rescues the remaining 300 SAO players, foiling Sugou\'s plans. Before leaving ALO to see Asuna, Kayaba, who has uploaded his mind to the Internet using an experimental and destructively high-power version of NerveGear at the cost of his life, entrusts Kirito with The Seed – a package program designed to create virtual worlds. Kazuto eventually reunites with Asuna in the real world after thwarting an attack from Sugou and The Seed is released onto the Internet, reviving Aincrad as other VRMMORPGs begin to thrive. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">One year after the events of SAO, at the prompting of a government official investigating strange occurrences in VR, Kazuto takes on a job to investigate a series of murders involving another VRMMORPG called Gun Gale Online (GGO), the AmuSphere (the successor of the NerveGear), and a player called Death Gun. Aided by a female player named Shino \"Sinon\" Asada, he participates in a gunfight tournament called the Bullet of Bullets (BoB) and discovers the truth behind the murders, which originated with a player who participated in a player-killing guild in SAO. Through his and Sinon\'s efforts, two suspects are captured, though the third suspect, Johnny Black, escapes. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">Kazuto is later recruited to test an experimental FullDive machine, Soul Translator (STL), which has an interface far more realistic and complex than the previous machine he had played, to help RATH, a research and development organization under the Ministry of Defense (MOD), develop an artificial intelligence named A.L.I.C.E. He tests the STL by entering the Underworld (UW), a virtual reality cyberspace created with The Seed package. In the UW, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito\'s memories of what happens inside are restricted. However, when Johnny Black ambushes and injures Kazuto with suxamethonium chloride, RATH recovers Kazuto</span><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">and places him back into the STL to preserve his mind while attempts are made to save him. During his time in Underworld, Kirito befriends Eugeo, a carver in a small village of Rulid, and helps him on a journey to save Alice Zuberg, his friend who was taken by a group of highly skilled warriors known as the Integrity Knights for accidentally breaking a rule of the Axiom Church, the leaders of the Human Empire. He and Eugeo soon find themselves uncovering the secrets of the Axiom Church, led by a woman only known as \"The Administrator\", and the true purpose of Underworld itself, while unbeknownst to them, a war against the opposing Dark Territory is brewing on the horizon. They meet Alice, now an Integrity Knight, and though she does not remember them, Kirito helps her remember her true identity: a form of true artificial intelligence known as A.L.I.C.E.

Devils originate from Hell, and exist in a cycle between Earth and Hell: they migrate to Earth when killed in Hell, and vice versa. Dwelling in Hell are extremely powerful Devils called Primal Fears, which have never been killed. Transit between planes appears to be overseen by the Hell Devil (地獄の悪魔, Jigoku no Akuma). </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">A Devil may, in certain conditions, inhabit the body of a dead human, gaining some of their memories and personality; such a creature is called a Fiend (魔人, Majin, lit. Demonic Person). In rare cases, a living Fiend Host is possible where the dead human is able to retain their personality and balance control of the body with their inhabitant, who they are able to directly converse with. Devils who naturally have a humanoid form are said to be benevolent to humans. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Devils can make contracts with humans, where in exchange for a sacrifice the human makes, the human can summon the Devil until either the contract expires or the Devil terminates it. The events of the story take place in 1997, in an alternate timeline where the Soviet Union still exists, and many events such as the Holocaust, AIDS and nuclear weapons are revealed to have been erased from history and have ceased to exist entirely due to the consumption of their respective Devils by the Chainsaw Devil, with only a powerful group of devils known as the Four Horsemen (Control, War, Hunger/Famine, Death) remembering the original events. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Likewise, there has been no war since the First World War as the War Devil has been weakened to the point that the only traces of war exist in pop culture and media.</p><hr><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b>Plot Summary</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Denji is a young man trapped in poverty, working off his deceased father\'s debt to the yakuza by working as a Devil Hunter, aided by Pochita, his canine companion and Chainsaw Devil. Denji is betrayed by the yakuza, who kill him for a contract with the Zombie Devil. Pochita makes a contract with Denji, merging with him as a human-devil Hybrid, under the condition that Denji live out his dreams. Denji then becomes </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Chainsaw Man and massacres the yakuza. In the aftermath, he is approached by a team of governmental Devil Hunters, the Public Safety Division, led by Makima, who charms him into joining their ranks. Denji joins Public Safety and is partnered with Power, the Blood Fiend, and Aki Hayakawa, a self-destructive Devil Hunter. Makima promises Denji any favor, provided he kill the Gun Devil, perpetrator of the greatest massacre in human history. Denji fights through multiple Devils and enemies who seek Chainsaw Man\'s power, and trains with Power under the veteran Devil Hunter Kishibe to improve his survivability, but also loses several friends and teammates after several bloody missions under Makima to search for the Gun Devil.&nbsp; </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Makima later turns out to be the Control Devil, with a contract with the Japanese government that effectively makes her immortal. She manipulated events to crush Denji\'s dreams in order to separate him from his contract with Pochita, as the Chainsaw Devil has the power to completely erase evil concepts from the world by consuming their Devils. Makima furthers her goal by using her powers to resurrect Aki as the Gun Fiend and force Denji to kill him in self-defense, and later kills Power in front of Denji after he uses his favor to become her dog. Denji turns catatonic and completely turns his body over to Pochita, but Kishibe organizes a raid to rescue Denji, seeing him as the last hope of defeating Makima, even as she uses resurrected hybrids of their defeated enemies to fight back.&nbsp; With the help of Kishibe, a frightened former teammate named Kobeni Higashiyama, and a fragment of Power<br></p>', 'denji-makes-a-contract-with-the-chainsaw-devil', '9anime-1674560192.jpg', '2023-01-24 08:36:32', '2023-01-24 08:36:32'),

Now Akatsuki, the mysterious organization of elite rogue ninja, is closing in on their grand plan which may threaten the safety of the entire shinobi world. Although Naruto is older and sinister events loom on the horizon, he has changed little in personality—still rambunctious and childish—though he is now far more confident and possesses an even greater determination to protect his friends and home. Come whatever may, Naruto will carry on with the fight for what is important to him, even at the expense of his own body, in the continuation of the saga about the boy who wishes to become Hokage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b>Part I</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making Naruto a host of the beast;[i] this costs Naruto\'s father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha\'s villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Naruto then defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino.[ii] Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations. After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams. During the exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic heritage, the Sharingan.[iii] After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi,[iv] who had showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a group of ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke; Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade\'s apprentice.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b>Part II</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara, who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi had been ordered by Konoha\'s superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a coup; he accepted, on the condition that Sasuke would be spared. Devastated by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village\'s respect and admiration. With Nagato\'s death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha\'s founding fathers), announces that he wants to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to cast an illusion powerful enough to control all humanity and achieve world peace. The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join forces to confront his faction and allies. That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi World War between the combined armies of the Five Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki\'s forces of zombie-like ninjas. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Five Kage try to keep Naruto, unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island with Killer Bee, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that time, Naruto—along with the help of Killer Bee—gains control of his Tailed Beast and the two of them head for the battlefield. During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha and not Madara as he claimed. Obito is a former teammate of Kakashi\'s who was thought to be dead. The real Madara saved Obito\'s life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances that led to his clan\'s downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito\'s plans. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">However, Madara\'s body ends up possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki, an ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.<br></p>', 'the-boy-who-became-hokage', '9anime-1674560761.png', '2023-01-24 08:46:01', '2023-01-24 08:46:01'),

It is notable that in Korea \'Bam\' can mean \'Night\' or \'Chestnut\'. He has spent most of his life trapped beneath a vast and mysterious Tower, with only his close friend, Rachel, to keep him company. When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam is devastated. Somehow, Bam manages to open the door to the Tower. Now, he will go any distance to see Rachel again even if it means dying. When he enters the Tower, he meets allies that will help him up the tower.</p><p><b>Settings within Tower of God</b></p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The Tower</span></td><td style=\"text-align: justify; \"><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">\"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is because ascension from one floor to the next is only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Regulars are any individuals from the Outer Tower chosen to climb the tower in the Inner Tower. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"Ten Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as <b><i>King Jahad</i></b> (or \'Zahard\', in some translations) is the chief leader of this body. Each floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by <b><i>Headon</i></b>, the First Floor\'s Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in Tower of God. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the manhwa, and Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them. According to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent. Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. Only Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad.&nbsp;</span><br></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Shinsu</span></td><td style=\"text-align: justify; \"><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Shinsu (Hangul: 신수, RR: Shin-soo), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High Shinsu resistance is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. Shinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-방) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-면), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-수). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-신수강화-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu.</span></p><p>Shinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam. However there are certain exceptions to rules regarding Shinsu. Individuals known as \"Irregulars\" seem to have a special connection with the tower, being able to use Shinsu with little to no constraints, regardless of whether or not they have contracts with the same administrators of the floors they\'re on or going to. </p><p>One highly notable irregular known simply as \"Enryu\" even managed to kill the then administrator and guardian of the 43rd floor. A feat once thought to be impossible on the apparently false pretense that Administrators were thought to be immortal and otherwise infallible. This has led many of the tower\'s inhabitants to see irregulars as little more than highly destructive entities with unfathomable powers and abilities, as well as being regarded as calamities brought forth by the tower\'s prophecies in an effort to bring about change to the tower.<br></p><hr><p>Most battles in the tower are done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman (낚시꾼 nakksiggun), spear-bearer (창지기 changjigi), light-bearer (등대지기 deungdaejigi), scout (탐색꾼 tamsaekggun), and wave-controller (파도잡이 padojabi). Fishermen are direct fighters, spear-bearers are a fighting support class, light-bearers provide distant reconnaissance, scouts provide on-ground reconnaissance, and wave-controllers control Shinsu. There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.<br></p></td></tr></tbody></table>', 'the-boy-bam-climbs-the-tower-in-search-of-rachael', '9anime-1674562701.jpg', '2023-01-24 09:18:21', '2023-01-24 09:18:21');

Raditz along with two elites, Vegeta and Nappa, are the only remaining Saiyan warriors, so Raditz comes to enlist Goku\'s help in conquering frontier worlds. When Goku refuses to join them, Raditz takes Goku and Krillin down with one strike, kidnaps Gohan, and threatens to murder him if Goku doesn\'t kill 100 humans within the next 24 hours. Goku decides to team up with his arch-enemy Piccolo, who was also defeated by Raditz in an earlier encounter, to defeat him and save his son.

But before Raditz succumbs to his injuries, he reveals to Piccolo that the other two Saiyans are much stronger than him and will come for the Dragon Balls in one year. Having witnessed Gohan\'s latent potential, Piccolo takes him into the wilderness to train for the upcoming battle against the Saiyan Elites. In the afterlife, Goku travels the million-kilometer Snake Way so that he can train under the ruler of the North Galaxy, King Kai.

Naofumi happened to receive the Legendary Shield, the sole defensive equipment, while the other heroes received respectively a sword, a spear, and a bow, weapons meant for attack. Unlike the other heroes who are fully supported by the kingdom and gain several strong allies each, Naofumi\'s luck turns to the worse after his single companion, revealed to be the kingdom\'s princess, betrays him, steals all his belongings, and leaves him devoid of all assistance and supplies after she falsely accuses him of sexually assaulting her. </span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); font-size: var(--bs-body-font-size); font-weight: var(--bs-body-font-weight); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\">Mocked by the nobility and shunned by everyone from his fellow Heroes to peasants, a now cynical Naofumi is forced to train as a hero alone while working to make ends meet, until he buys from a slave trader a young tanuki demi-human girl named Raphtalia and an egg that hatches into a bird-like monster whom he names \"Filo\", both quickly growing into adulthood and becoming powerful warriors under his care.

Orphaned and the sole survivor of a massive fire in Fuyuki City as a child, Shirou was taken in by a retired magus named Kiritsugu Emiya, who died some years later. Shirou\'s feelings of responsibility for those who died and his own salvation through his father formed a strong desire for justice and peace in him. Thus, he earnestly trains his body and minuscule ability with magic with the goal of helping others, even if people often abuse his generosity. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">One evening, Shirou unexpectedly comes across two warriors, Archer and Lancer, fighting at his school. He is attacked and nearly killed by Lancer, but Archer\'s master, Rin Tohsaka manages to revive him just before death. However, Lancer attacks again, and just before Shirou is about to be killed, he accidentally summons his Servant, Saber, who saves his life. With this summoning, the marks of the Command Seal appear on Shirou\'s hand, formalizing his entry as a Master into the Holy Grail War. As Saber forces Lancer to flee, she engages in combat with Archer, but Shirou accidentally stops her with his magic upon seeing Rin, his schoolmate. Shirou and Rin decide to form an alliance to fight against other mages. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Through the priest Kirei Kotomine, Shirou learns about the Holy Grail War\'s context. Although initially hesitant, he decides to participate to avoid future catastrophes happening as a result of wishes granted by the Holy Grail. As the war continues, Shirou starts developing his own skills as a magus by imitating Archer\'s abilities, and Rin notes striking similarities between the two. However, in a battle against the servant Caster in an attempt to rescue his guardian Fujimura, Shirou loses control of Saber, who is imprisoned by Caster. Shirou vows to fight with his own magical strength to stop the war and save his friends. Archer betrays Rin during a fight against Caster, but Rin reforms her alliance with Shirou. With Lancer\'s help, the duo manages to free Saber from Caster who is then killed. To gain more allies, Rin and Shirou decide to team up with Illyasviel von Einzbern and her servant Berserker. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">However, Gilgamesh, Kotomine\'s former servant, arrives and kills both Illya and Berserker before Rin and Shirou can stop him. At Illya\'s villa, Archer challenges Shirou to a fight, hoping to destroy Shirou\'s goals of being a hero. Confused, Saber demands to know what his true intentions are, and Archer reveals himself to be a version of Shirou from the future, who became a heroic spirit after becoming disillusioned with the path he took. However, Shirou accepts his future regardless of Archer\'s regrets, deciding to stick to Kiritsugu\'s ideals of being a hero. Gilgamesh tries to kill Archer and Shirou, but the former sacrifices himself to protect the latter. Gilgamesh takes Illya\'s heart, planning to use his other master Shinji Matou in order to summon the corrupted Holy Grail. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">In order to follow Archer\'s hopes, Rin passes Shirou her mana to fight Gilgamesh to replicate Archer\'s powers. As Shirou nearly kills Gilgamesh, Archer uses the last of his strength to deliver the final attack at their enemy while assisting Saber to destroy the Holy Grail. With the war concluded and the servants gone, Shirou and Rin move to London to learn more about magic, and Shirou vows once again to retain Kiritsugu\'s ideals. In a post-credits scene, Archer appears in another dimension, and disappears as he remembers his past self\'s words, just as another, younger, hooded person appears in the same field.<br></p>', 'fate-stay-night-unlimited-bladeworks', '9anime-1674629040.png', '2023-01-25 03:44:00', '2023-01-25 03:44:00'),

For three years, he has trained enough to defeat any enemy with a single punch, his unmatched strength leaving him bored. He becomes a reluctant mentor to Genos, a cyborg seeking revenge against another cyborg who killed his family and destroyed his hometown, after Saitama defeats a monster that defeated Genos. Saitama and Genos join the Hero Association, hoping to attain notability, but Genos instantly obtains an S-Class rank; meanwhile, due to scoring low on the written exam despite having a perfect score on the physical exam, Saitama only becomes a C-Class hero. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">His feats remain unnoticed even after saving people from an asteroid and then a sea monster, barely getting himself promoted to B-Class.

Monsters begin appearing faster while the rogue martial artist Garo, a former apprentice of the hero Bang, and self-dubbed \"Hero Hunter,\" begins terrorizing heroes. Due to childhood bullying, he holds a grudge against everything \"heroic.\" The heroes learn that the monster influx comes from the Monster Association, an organization of monsters under City Z intent on destroying the Hero Association. They attack various cities, recruit fighters by offering them \"monster cells\" that mutate humans into monsters, and kidnap a Hero Association executive\'s son. Garo bonds with Tareo, a child who idolizes heroes, as he hunts down more heroes, his combat prowess slowly rising. The Monster Association attempts to recruit him and kidnaps the child when Garo refuses. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">He storms the <b><i>Monster Association</i></b> HQ trying to rescue the child but ultimately gets captured.

Unable to match the power of Saitama, Garo receives some of \"God\'s\" power when he meets it in a vision, causing him to emit radiation that kills all the heroes, including Genos by ripping out his core to get Saitama to fight him seriously. He briefly matches Saitama in a brutal battle that sends them across the solar system. After Saitama defeats him, Garo becomes distraught over Tareo\'s death and teaches Saitama to time travel before \"God\" kills him. Saitama goes back in time and subdues Garo before he killed the heroes, destroying his monster mutation and cosmic power. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Despite the objections of the other heroes, Saitama spares Garo and lets him flee after Tareo stops them. Only Genos, who reconnected with his core from the original timeline bought by Saitama (who seemed to remember nothing of his battle and time travel with the original Garo), remembers the entire events of the original ominous future caused by Garo. With the Monster Association destroyed, Saitama gets promoted to A-Class for defeating Garo. As the battle destroyed his apartment, he relocates to the Hero Association\'s HQ in A-City. The Hero Association\'s poor performance causes public opinion of them to plummet.

The Warlords consist of Crocodile, Boa Hancock, Jinbe, Gecko Moria, Dracule Mihawk, Bartholomew Kuma, Donquixote Doflamingo, Edward Weevil, Blackbeard and Trafalgar D. Law. This system was made so that the Pirates could help the marines whenever they needed their help and in return, they would make them \'legal pirates\'. This system was eventually disbanded because a lot of the Shichibukai started abusing their powers.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b>Crocodile</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">We get to the fact that Crocodile is already a Warlord (Shichibukai) of the sea at the start of the series. After joining the Warlords, he settled in Alabasta and founded Baroque Works in order to rule Alabasta under him. He has the Suna Suna devil fruit which gives him the ability to turn himself or control sand. He made a drought happen in Alabasta and framed the King in order to start a rebellion. Crocodile had planned to save the people of Alabasta and act as their so that they name him the new king but that didn\'t happen as the Straw Hats intervened in their plans. After the whole Alabasta incident, the World Government saw what Crocodile had done and immediately revoked and he was put into prison.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b>Boa Hancock</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Boa Hancock was sold as a slave when she was just a child and was forced to eat the Mero Mero devil fruit which gave her the power over Impure hearts. As she had quite overwhelming strength and even the conqueror haki, Hancock soon became the captain of the Kuja Pirates. To ensure her land Amazon Lily\'s safety, she became a Warlord, despite hating on the government for treating her badly when she was a slave. Hancock stayed a Warlord till the World Government decided to disband the Shichibukai.<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b>Jinbe</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Just like Boa Hancock, Jinbe also became a Warlord to protect the people of Fishman Island as they weren\'t treated well and suffered injustice. He continued on with his mentor\'s legacy and morals. When he was invited to be a Warlord he agreed so that he could use the power to improve the relationship between humans and fishermen. But that relationship didn\'t go well when the Warlords were told to fight in the Marineford war and go against Whitebeard. As he did not agree to this, Jinbe was imprisoned and was expelled from being a Warlord.<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b>Gecko Moria</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Gecko Moria is the antagonist that was introduced during the Thriller Bark arc.

When the World Government got to know about his island ship crew and his experiments, they started to take action. Moria wasn\'t revoked of his title instead the World Government ordered his silent assassination to take place string the Marineford war.

He takes care of all the Warlord\'s duties without a complaint and even took part in the Marineford war even though he didn\'t agree with its reasoning.Even though he is loyal to the World Government, Mihawk does as he pleases and even personally trains Roronoa Zoro.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\"><b>Bartholomew Kuma</b></span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Bartholomew Kuma is actually a part of the Revolutionary Army and he became a Warlord and acted as their spy.

And after transforming him into a cyborg, those blueprints were used to create an army of Pacifistas.

After getting defeated by Luffy and the whole truth exposed by Admiral Fujitora, Dolflamingo\'s title was removed and his reign of terror was put to an end.

Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, Noroi), a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These curses are shown as gruesome monsters, ghosts, and yōkais. Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪術師, Jujutsushi, lit. \"Cursed Technique Masters\" or \"Shamans\") are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and also to reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques (呪術式, Jujutsushiki), which tend to be unique to the user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion (領域展開, Ryōiki Tenkai), which the users build a pocket dimension of variable size.

Due to Sukuna\'s evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and, by extension, Itadori) immediately. But upon seeing Itadori retaining control over his body, Fushiguro\'s teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School with a proposal to his superiors: postpone Itadori\'s death sentence and train under Gojo until he consumes all of Sukuna\'s fingers so the Curse can be eliminated. At the same time, a group of cursed spirits plot a multi-layered attack on the world of jujutsu sorcery, including the Cursed spirit Mahito and a corrupted sorcerer named Suguru Geto, who was executed by Gojo a year prior. The Kyoto school\'s principal wants Itadori dead immediately at the exchange event between the Tokyo and Kyoto jujutsu schools. In contrast, others, including fellow student Nobara Kugisaki, side with Gojo to keep Itadori alive. The disfigured Kyoto Jujutsu Tech second-year student Kokichi Muta, who pilots Mechamaru, is revealed to be a mole. Geto and the cursed spirits lay a screen over Shibuya. Various sorcerers arrive at the scene to fight them. Gojo fights off cursed spirits and exorcises Hanami, a high-ranking cursed spirit, but is sealed away by Geto in a certain artifact. The events also reveal that the current Geto is not the original but rather Geto\'s corpse possessed by an ancient sorcerer named Kenjaku. Itadori and his allies face Kenjaku\'s forces, with Gojo still trapped inside the artifact. As the incident ends, Kenjaku reveals that he has been jumping from body to body for thousands of years and implanting Binding Vows, which in turn awakens thousands of new sorcerers throughout Japan, including Tsumiki Fushiguro, Megumi\'s step-sister. He then unleashes a slew of curses on Japan, ushering in chaos and a world of cursed spirits reminiscent of the Heian period. In the aftermath, Itadori and Fushiguro team up with second-year student Yuta Okkotsu and Yuki Tsukumo, a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and one of the most powerful sorcerers of all time, along with half-human, half-Curse Choso and second-year student Maki Zen\'in to meet with Tengen.

The demons are former humans who were turned into demons by Muzan Kibutsuji injecting them with his own blood, and they feed on humans and possess supernatural abilities such as super strength, powers that demons can obtain called \"Blood Demon Art\", and regeneration. Demons can only be killed if they are decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy known as Nichirin, injected with poison extracted from wisteria flowers, or exposed to sunlight. The Demon Slayers, on the other hand, are entirely human; however, they employ special elemental breathing techniques, known as \"Breathing Styles\", which grant them superhuman strength and increased resistance, helping them fight against demons. The strongest Demon Slayers are known as the Hashira, and gain this rank through either killing a member of the Twelve Kizuki (the twelve strongest demons under Muzan) or killing fifty demons after ranking up multiple times.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Plot</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">﻿</span><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. He became his family\'s breadwinner after his father\'s death, making trips to the nearby village to sell charcoal. Everything changed when he came home one day to discover that his family was attacked and slaughtered by a demon. Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko were the sole survivors of the incident, with Nezuko being transformed into a demon, but still surprisingly showing signs of human emotion and thought. After an encounter with Giyū Tomioka, the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyū and sent to his retired master Sakonji Urokodaki for training to also become a demon slayer, beginning his quest to help his sister turn into human again and avenge the death of his family. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">After two years of strenuous training, Tanjiro takes part in a formidable exam and is one of the few survivors to pass, officially making him a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. He begins his work of hunting down and slaying demons alongside Nezuko, who has been hypnotized to bring no harm to humans and who occasionally helps him in battle. One of Tanjiro\'s assignments brings him to Asakusa where he encounters Muzan Kibutsuji, the progenitor of all demons and the one who murdered his family. He also meets Tamayo and Yushiro, demons who are free from Muzan\'s control. Tamayo and Yushiro ally with Tanjiro and begin to develop a cure for Nezuko, though it will require Tanjiro to supply Tamayo with blood from the Twelve Kizuki, the most powerful demons under Muzan\'s command. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">Continuing his missions, Tanjiro meets Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira, fellow survivors of the exam with whom he forms an unlikely team during a battle with the former Lower Rank Six of the Kizuki. The group soon face off against Lower Rank Five of the Kizuki, although Tanjiro unlocks a mysterious ability called \"Hinokami Kagura\", they are ultimately outmatched; they are rescued by Giyū and Insect Hashira Shinobu Kocho and brought back to headquarters. There, the Kamado siblings partake in a council between Kagaya Ubuyashiki, the leader of the Demon Slayer Corps, and the Hashira, the Corps\' most elite members, who (with the exception of Giyū) do not believe that Nezuko should be allowed to live. However, Kagaya nonetheless manages to convince them to accept her. With this agreement, Tanjiro begins to work alongside the Hashira, where he encounters significantly more resistance from the demons. Alongside the Hashira and Corps members, Tanjiro takes part in numerous harrowing battles against the Kizuki, which they survive by narrow margins while also taking losses of their own, including the death of Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku and retirement of Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui. During a battle in the Swordsmith Village, Tanjiro meets Genya Shinazugawa, the younger brother of Wind Hashira Sanemi Shinazugawa, who has the mysterious ability to temporarily become a demon by eating demon flesh. It is also discovered that Nezuko is invulnerable to sunlight, a discovery that makes her the prime target of Muzan, who has long sought a way to overcome the sun and thus become the ultimate being. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">Tanjiro also learns that his Hinokami Kagura is descended from Sun Breathing, the original breathing style invented by Yoriichi Tsugikuni, the first and strongest demon slayer, and develops it to prepare to fight Muzan. Kagaya forecasts Muzan\'s intentions and enacts a strict training regiment of the entire Corps to prepare for the upcoming battle. With the blood samples obtained from the Kizuki, Tamayo develops a serum to cure Nezuko, who is kept isolated far from the battle as she recovers. Muzan soon appears before Kagaya, who triggers a suicide attack to stagger him. The Hashira and Tanjiro ambush Muzan, but he traps them all within Infinity Castle, an endless labyrinth which houses the remaining Kizuki. Tamayo restrains Muzan with a poison she concocted, leaving him vulnerable for attack. To reach him, the Corps defeat the remaining Kizuki members, though many are killed, including Shinobu and Genya. Muzan kills Tamayo by crushing and absorbing her but is forced above ground by the Corps.

Helpless against the sun, Muzan forcefully gives his remaining blood to a dying Tanjiro and transforms him into the ultimate demon in a last-ditch effort to have his species survive. Tanjiro begins to attack the remaining Corps members, but through the efforts of his allies and Nezuko, who has been fully restored to her human self, he is turned back into a human. In the aftermath of the battle, the Corps are disbanded as the death of Muzan has effectively vanquished all other demons (except for Yushiro, who leaves to live a peaceful life as a painter). Tanjiro and Nezuko return to their family home, accompanied by Zenitsu and Inosuke. Tanjiro marries fellow demon slayer Kanao Tsuyuri while Nezuko marries Zenitsu. In a modern-day epilogue, the descendants and reincarnations of the Corps members enjoy a peaceful life free of demons.</span><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><br></span></p>', 'tanjiro-joins-the-vampire-slayers', '9anime-1675067053.jpg', '2023-01-30 05:24:13', '2023-01-30 05:24:13');

Initially terrified of its god-like power, Light considers the possibilities of the Death Note\'s abilities and kills high-profile Japanese criminals, then targets international criminals. Five days after discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a \"shinigami\" and the Death Note\'s previous owner. Ryuk, invisible to anyone who has not touched the notebook, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is amused by Light\'s actions. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">As criminals around the world die from inexplicable accidents and heart attacks, the global media suggest that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious murders and name them \"Kira\" (キラ, the Japanese transliteration of the word \"killer\"). Hoping to apprehend Kira, Interpol requests the assistance of an enigmatic consulting detective, known as L, to assist their investigation. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">Deducing that Kira is based in Japan, L tricks Light into revealing that he is in the Kanto region of Japan by manipulating him to kill a decoy. Furious, Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing his plans. L deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police investigation, being led by Light\'s father, Soichiro Yagami. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">Under the suspicion that \"Kira\" could have family ties with members of the \"Kira\" investigation, L assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor the families of those connected with the investigation and L learns enough to designate Light as the prime suspect. Around this time, Light graduates from high school to college. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">L recruits Light into the Kira Task Force, with each trying to get the other to reveal crucial information. Actress-model Misa Amane, having obtained a second Death Note from a shinigami named Rem, makes a deal with Rem for shinigami eyes, which reveal the names of anyone whose face she sees, at the cost of half her lifespan. Seeking to have Light become her boyfriend, Misa uncovers Light\'s identity as the original Kira, but Light has another motive: he intends to use Misa\'s shinigami eyes to discern L\'s true name. L deduces that Misa is likely the second Kira and detains her. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">Rem threatens to kill Light if he does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he and Misa temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, and has Rem pass the Death Note to a less morally driven individual, Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group. With memories of the Death Note erased, Light joins the investigation and, together with L, deduce Higuchi\'s identity and arrest him. Light regains his memories and uses the Death Note to kill Higuchi, regaining possession of the book. After restoring Misa\'s memories, Light instructs her to begin killing as Kira, causing L to cast suspicion on Misa. With Light insinuating the investigation would lead to Misa\'s capture and execution, Rem realizes Light\'s plan all along was to have her sacrifice herself to kill L, as a shinigami may not kill others to prevent a human\'s death. After Rem kills L, she disintegrates and Light obtains her Death Note. The task force does not announce L\'s death and agrees to have Light operate as the new L. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">With Light working as both L and Kira, the investigation stalls but crime rates continue to drop as he no longer has a threat of capture. Four years later, cults that worship Kira have risen. Two young men, raised as potential successors to L, are revealed: Near and Mello. Mello joins the mafia whilst Near joins forces with the US government. Mello kidnaps Director Takimura, who Light then kills, so Mello, kidnaps Light\'s sister and exchanges her for the Death Note, using it to kill almost all of Near\'s team. A Shinigami named Sidoh goes to Earth to reclaim his notebook and ends up meeting and helping Mello. Light uses the notebook to find Mello\'s hideout, but Soichiro is killed in the mission. Mello and Near exchange information and Mello kidnaps Mogi and gives him to Near. Kira supporters attack Near\'s group, but they escape. Aizawa becomes suspicious in Light and meets with Near. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">As suspicion falls again on Misa, Light passes Misa\'s Death Note to a fervent supporter of Kira, Teru Mikami. He also appoints newscaster Kiyomi Takada as Kira\'s public spokesperson. Near has Mikami followed whilst Aizawa\'s suspicions are confirmed. Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps her. Takada kills Mello but is killed by Light. Near arranges a meeting between Light and the current Kira Task Force members. Light tries to have Mikami kill Near as well as all the task force members, but Mikami\'s Death Note fails to work, having been replaced with a decoy. Perusing the names Mikami had written down, only Light\'s is missing, which proves Light is Kira. Light is grievously wounded in a scuffle and begs Ryuk to write the names of everyone present. Ryuk instead writes down Light\'s name in his Death Note, as he had promised to do the day they met, and Light dies. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); font-size: 14px;\">One year later, the world has returned to normal and the Kira Taskforce Members are conflicted over whether they made the right decision. Meanwhile, cults worshipping Kira have risen, led by a woman resembling Misa. Three years later, Near, now functioning as the new L, receives word that a new Kira has appeared. Hearing that the new Kira is randomly killing people, Near concludes that the new Kira is an attention-seeker and denounces the new Kira as \"boring\" and not worth catching. A shinigami named Midora approaches Ryuk and gives him an apple from the human realm, in a bet to see if a random human could become the new Kira, but Midora loses the bet when the human writes his own name in the Death Note after hearing Near\'s announcement. Ryuk tells Midora that no human would ever surpass Light as the new Kira.</span><b><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><br></span></b></p>', 'light-yagami-finds-the-death-note', '9anime-1675067472.jpg', '2023-01-30 05:31:12', '2023-01-30 05:31:12'),

The survivors took refuge in the Tokyo Empire, which remained mostly stable during the period despite losing some of its landmass. The Tokyo Emperor Raffles I establishes the faith of the Holy Sol Temple as it and Haijima Industries developed the perpetual thermal energy plant Amaterasu to power the country. In Year 198 of Tokyo\'s Solar Era, special fire brigades called the Fire Force fight increasing incidents of spontaneous human combustion where human beings are turned into living infernos called \"Infernals\".[Jp. 1] While the Infernals are first generation cases of spontaneous human combustion, with more powerful horned variations known as Demons, later generations possess pyrokinesis while retaining human form.

There are an endless number of Quirks, and it is extremely unlikely to find two people who have the exact same power, unless they are closely related. Among the Quirk-enhanced individuals, a few of them earn the title of Heroes, who cooperate with the authorities in rescue operations and apprehending criminals who abuse their powers, commonly known as Villains. In addition, Heroes who excel on their duties gain celebrity status and are recognized as \"Pro Heroes\" (プロヒーロー, Puro Hīrō). </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Most heroes are popular based on their rankings, with higher ranking heroes receiving more popularity and public appeal, although it isn\'t uncommon for rookie heroes to gain such popularity as well. In the early existence of Heroes, the people who volunteered to do their heroic duties without a permission, are recognized as \"Vigilantes\" (ヴィジランテ, Vijirante). Those students who have acted as vigilantes, are not allowed to perform as heroes due to the regulations and Quirk restriction laws managed by the Hero Public Safety Commission (ヒーロー公安委員会, Hīrō Kōan Iinkai). While the act of vigilantism is inherently illegal, the vigilantes themselves represent a gray line in the eyes of the law. The Hero Public Safety Commission originally enlisted vigilantes to do their dirty work until they became too organized for the vigilantes to properly deal with, so they abandoned the idea and instead focused on recruiting Pro Heroes to handle the job.

It involves a student merely shadowing a Pro Hero, listening to their advice and watching them in action for an entire week. Since the students are unlicensed, they cannot legally work as heroes. And the second type is the Hero Work-Study where a student acquires a Hero License after passing the Provisional Hero License Exam.

Just when Taiju begins his confession however, a blinding green light strikes the Earth and petrifies mankind around the world—turning every single human into stone. Several millennia later, Taiju awakens to find the modern world completely nonexistent, as nature has flourished in the years humanity stood still. Among a stone world of statues, Taiju encounters one other living human: his science-loving friend Senkuu, who has been active for a few months. Taiju learns that Senkuu has developed a grand scheme—to launch the complete revival of civilization with science. Taiju\'s brawn and Senkuu\'s brains combine to forge a formidable partnership, and they soon uncover a method to revive those petrified. However, Senkuu\'s master plan is threatened when his ideologies are challenged by those who awaken.

The rōnin was born malformed, limbless and without facial features or internal organs. This was the result of his birth father daimyō Kagemitsu Daigō forging a pact with 48 sealed demons so that he might rule the land and increase its wealth and prosperity. In return, he promised the demons anything that they wanted which belonged to him. This enabled them to roam free and commit atrocities along the countryside. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">After his mother Nui no Kata was forced to set him adrift on the river, lest he be killed by his father, the infant was subsequently found and raised by Jukai, a medicine man who used healing magic and alchemist methods to give the child prostheses crafted from the remains of children who had died in the war. The boy became nearly invincible against any mortal blow as a result of the prostheses and healing magic. Grafted into his left arm was a very special blade that a traveling storyteller presented to Jukai, believing it was fated to be within his possession given that ever since the boy had been discovered, the doctor had been visited by goblins. As revealed in a short tale about the blade\'s origin, the blade had been forged out of vengeance to kill goblins as well as other supernatural entities. After the sensei was forced to send him on his way because he was attracting demons, the young man learned from a ghostly voice of the curse that had been set upon him at birth and that by killing the demons responsible he could reclaim the stolen pieces of his body and thus regain his humanity. Across his travels, he earned the name \"Hyakkimaru\" (百鬼丸) among other names for his inhuman nature. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">On one such hunt of a demon, Hyakkimaru came across a young orphan thief named Dororo who thereafter travels by his side through the war-torn countryside. When Hyakkimaru met Dororo, he had already killed 15 demons. Throughout their journey, Hyakkimaru killed six more demons, bringing the total to 21. Along the way, Hyakkimaru learns that Dororo was hiding a big secret. Dororo\'s father, Bandit Hibukuro, hid money he saved up on his raids on Bone Cape to later be distributed to the people squeezed dry by the samurai. Itachi, a bandit who betrayed Hibukuro and sided with the authorities, crippled Hibukuro. Hibukuro escaped with limping legs, along with his wife and young child. Hibukuro dies trying to let his remaining family escape. Fearing that she, too, will die, Ojyui had prayed to Buddha and, with her blood, drew the map that will lead him to Bone Cape. Three days later, she froze to death. Itachi kidnapped Dororo and used the map on \"his\" back to lead them to Bone Cape. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">A mysterious boatman ferried them to the Cape but he had two demon sharks with him. One of the sharks ate half of Itachi\'s bandits while the other shark left with the boatman. However, Dororo and the remaining bandits managed to kill the shark. When the boatman and the second shark returned, Dororo was able to separate the boatman and the shark. Hyakkimaru arrived to stab the shark in one of its eyes, but It escaped. They held the boatman prisoner and then they landed on Bone Cape. The boatman told the thirsty bandits of a spring not too far from their camp, and they went to drink, leaving Itachi, Dororo, the boatman and Hyakkimaru. Dororo later found their corpses and blood leading to the half-blind shark. Hyakkimaru killed the shark and the boatman, then recovered his real voice. Itachi went to search for the money but only found a letter from Hibukuro saying that he hid it somewhere else. The Magistrate arrived under the pretense of getting rid of the bandits but actually came for the treasure. Hyakkimaru, Dororo, and Itachi kill them, but Itachi was left for dead. Hyakkimaru and Dororo continued on their journey. Sometime later Hyakkimaru learns that his father, Kagemitsu Daigo, was possessed by the 48 demons, and went to slay him. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Things were going badly on the Daigo clan\'s land, and the citizens were forced to build a fort for him. The slaves were planning a rebellion, but one of the slaves told Kagemitsu of their plans, and he was prepared. His archers shot and killed many slaves and the remainder hid in a tunnel they had built under the fort. Hyakkimaru left Dororo and ran into the fort. Dororo joined the slaves in their ambush, but Kagemitsu Daigo\'s soldiers caught Dororo. To prove his loyalty, Kagemitsu told Hyakkimaru to kill Dororo. Hyakkimaru acted as if he was about to kill Dororo but turned around and threw his sword into the dark stabbing the physical manifestation of the 48 demons, however, some of them managed to escape. The slaves charged through the tunnel and attacked Kagemitsu\'s soldiers. Kagemitsu, weak because of the slain demons, escaped with his wife Nui.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"> After he regained his eyes, Hyakkimaru figured out that Dororo is female, though Dororo rejects the notion and refers to himself as a boy despite Hyakkimaru\'s insistence to act more feminine. This is in part due to Dororo being raised as a boy by his parents in order to be tough. Hyakkimaru also wanted Dororo to fight with the farmers against those in power because Dororo\'s father was a farmer. Hyakkimaru gave his sword to Dororo, the one that he had desired throughout the series. Hyakkimaru planned to continue his journey alone, agreeing to meet Dororo again when Hyakkimaru\'s body was whole. They parted with Dororo crying at the doors.

The creature claims that within a year, he will destroy the planet next. However, he offers mankind a chance to avert this fate. In class 3-E, the End Class of Kunugigaoka Junior High School, the creature starts working as a homeroom teacher where he teaches his students regular subjects, as well as the ways of assassination. The Japanese government promises a reward of ¥10 billion to whoever among the students succeeds in killing the creature, whom they have named \"Koro-sensei\".[Jp. 1] However, this proves to be a highly unachievable task, as he has several superpowers at his disposal including accelerated regeneration, visual cloning, an invincible form, and the ability to move and fly at Mach 20. He is also the best teacher they could ask for, helping them to improve their grades, individual skills, and prospects for the future. As time goes on, the situation gets even more complicated as other assassins come after Koro-sensei\'s life, some coveting the reward, others for personal reasons. The students eventually learn the secrets involving him, the Moon\'s destruction, and his ties with their previous homeroom teacher including the true reason why he must be killed before the end of the school year. The series is narrated by Nagisa Shiota, one of the students in the class whose main strategy in killing Koro-sensei is making a list of all his weaknesses over time.

But now he has grown bored of the world governments\' futile attempts at killing him, so he strikes them an odd deal: permit him to be Class 3-E\'s homeroom teacher, and he\'ll allow the students to try and kill him however they\'d like to. Can the students successfully take him, now named \"Koro-sensei\", down and save the world despite the fact that he\'s ridiculously fast (so much so he can hit Mach 20), very cunning, nearly invincible, and definitely the best teacher they\'ve ever had—especially for an infamous class of twenty-six social misfits and academic underachievers whom society has given up on?

The original crew are Spike Spiegel, an exiled former hitman of the criminal Red Dragon Syndicate, and Jet Black, a former ISSP officer.

The series also makes specific references to or pastiches multiple films, including the works of John Woo and Bruce Lee, Midnight Run, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Alien. The series also includes extensive references and elements from science fiction, bearing strong similarities to the cyberpunk fiction of William Gibson.

After three inconclusive wars for the elusive Holy Grail, the Fourth War commences. The Einzbern family is determined to achieve victory in the Fourth War after three consecutive failures, no matter the cost.

At her funeral, Kaori\'s parents give Kōsei a letter from Kaori that reveals she was aware of her impending death and became more free-spirited, both as a person and in her music, so she would not take her regrets to Heaven.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"> She confesses she had been in love with Kōsei\'s piano playing since watching him perform at a concert when she was five. This inspired her to play the violin so she could play with him one day. Kaori fabricated her feelings towards Ryōta so she could get closer to Kōsei without hurting Tsubaki, who harbored affection for Kōsei. She then confesses her love for him. Tsubaki comforts Kōsei and tells him she will be by his side. Kaori also leaves behind a picture of herself as a child, coming back from the concert that inspired her, with Kōsei in the background. Kōsei later frames this picture.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b>Characters</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b>Kōsei Arima (有馬 公生, Arima Kōsei)</b> Voiced by: Natsuki Hanae[2] (Japanese); Max Mittelman[3] (English) Played by: Kento Yamazaki[4] (live-action film); Shintarō Anzai[5] (stage play) Kōsei is a former child prodigy in playing piano, dubbed the \"Human Metronome\" for his mechanical accuracy, a product of his mother Saki\'s strict method of teaching. When Saki dies, Kōsei becomes unable to hear the sound of his piano playing and he gives up on it. Two years later, he takes up the piano again after Kaori Miyazono persuades him to become her accompanist. Influenced by her emotional and unrestrained playing style, Kōsei falls in love with her. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b>Kaori Miyazono (宮園 かをり, Miyazono Kawori)</b> Voiced by: Risa Taneda[2] (Japanese); Erica Lindbeck[3] (English) Played by: Suzu Hirose[4] (live-action film); Arisa Matsunaga[5] (stage play) Kaori is Tsubaki\'s classmate, a free-spirited violinist who has been criticized by judging panels for her unwillingness to adhere strictly to the score but is popular with audiences. Kaori meets Kōsei when she asks Tsubaki to set her up with Ryōta. As their friendship grows, she eventually convinces Kōsei to play the piano again, first as her accompanist and later in a piano competition; halfway into the series, it is discovered that she has a medical condition and has undergone multiple surgeries because of it.

Gifted with a wide assortment of supernatural abilities ranging from telepathy to x-ray vision, he finds this so-called blessing to be nothing but a curse. As all the inconveniences his powers cause constantly pile up, all Kusuo aims for is an ordinary, hassle-free life—a life where ignorance is bliss. Unfortunately, the life of a psychic is far from quiet. Though Kusuo tries to stay out of the spotlight by keeping his powers a secret from his classmates, he ends up inadvertently attracting the attention of many odd characters, such as the empty-headed Riki Nendou and the delusional Shun Kaidou. Forced to deal with the craziness of the people around him, Kusuo comes to learn that the ordinary life he has been striving for is a lot more difficult to achieve than expected.<br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Kusuo Saiki (Kento Yamazaki) is a 16-year-old high school student. He was born with many powers, including telepathy and telekinesis. This may sound cool, but, according to Kusuo\'s experience, super powers are not as good as we imagine. He tries to live a normal life, despite having a power that upsets him. Kusuo Saiki now tries to keep a distance from others to hide his psychic abilities, but his classmates with distinct individuality gather under Kusuo.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Kusuo Saiki is an Ordinary High-School Student...or at least he tries to be one. He\'s actually a boy with Psychic Powers—an incredibly powerful boy with every imaginable psychic ability. If he wanted to do so, he could wipe out humanity in only three days. It sounds like he is perfect and has everything, right? Wrong! He can\'t shut off his powers, therefore his life is void of surprises, challenges, or sense of accomplishment. He also needs to avoid social interaction, both because he wants to keep his powers secret and because he thinks of himself as too different to relate to normal people. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Unfortunately, life has other ideas. The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. (斉木楠雄のΨ難 / Saiki Kusuo no PSI Nan) is a gag series by Shuuichi Asou, published by Shonen Jump since 2012. It follows Kusuo\'s attempts in living quietly, hiding his powers and avoiding standing out. It\'s something that would be easier if not for his quirky parents and a number of quirky classmates who insist on being friends with him. Cue lots of inner snarkery. The series concluded in 2018, followed by a short series of Yonkoma and then two final chapters published in Jump Giga. It has a couple of anime adaptations: a 2013 web-anime developed for the Jump LIVE app, and a TV anime for the summer of 2016, this time produced by JC Staff and directed by Hiroaki Sakurai. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">A second season of the anime premiered on January 17, 2018.

This anime wrapped up with a special covering the last few chapters of the manga, released in 2019. The last anime series, titled The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. Reawakened was produced by Netflix and adapts chapters not covered by the first three seasons, as well as the epilogue.

It is set in 2010 in Akihabara, Tokyo, and follows Rintaro Okabe, a self-proclaimed \"mad scientist\", who runs the \"Future Gadget Laboratory\" in an apartment together with his friends Mayuri Shiina and Itaru \"Daru\" Hashida. While attending a conference about time travel, Okabe finds the dead body of Kurisu Makise, a neuroscience researcher; he sends a text message about it to Daru and later discovers that Kurisu is alive and that the message arrived before he sent it. The laboratory members learn that the cell phone-operated microwave oven they are developing can send text messages back in time; they are joined by Kurisu, and investigate it, sending text messages – referred to as \"D-mails\" – to the past to change the present. Kurisu eventually creates a device that can send memories through the microwave oven, effectively allowing the user to time travel. SERN, a fictional organization based on CERN, learns of the time machine and sends people to the laboratory to retrieve it, killing Mayuri in the process. Okabe goes back in time multiple times to prevent Mayuri\'s death but fails each time. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">He learns that he needs to undo all the changes their D-mails have caused and does so until he realizes that undoing the first D-mail would return him to the timeline where Kurisu was found dead. Okabe and Kurisu tell each other about their romantic feelings for one another, after which Kurisu tells Okabe to save Mayuri. Daru hacks into SERN\'s database, and they delete the record of the D-mail, returning them to the original timeline. Later, Suzuha Amane, Daru\'s future daughter, arrives in a time machine to tell Okabe that the only way to prevent a time-travel arms race leading to World War III is to prevent Kurisu\'s father Nakabachi from killing her and stealing her time travel theories. Suzuha and Okabe travel back in time, but Okabe accidentally kills Kurisu himself. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Returning to the present, Okabe receives a message from his future self telling him that to escape the current timeline, he needs to save Kurisu while recreating the vision of the dead Kurisu that his past self saw. Traveling back in time again, he provokes Nakabachi into stabbing him, knocks Kurisu unconscious, and puts her in his pool of blood for his past self to see, causing the timeline to diverge into one where Kurisu lives and World War III does not occur.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b>Anime Production</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The anime adaptation was announced in July 2010 by Chiyomaru Shikura, the head of 5pb.[6] Steins;Gate was created at the animation studio White Fox, and was produced by Mika Nomura and Yoshinao Doi,[7][8] directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki and Takuya Satō,[9][10] and written by Jukki Hanada, with Kyuuta Sakai serving as character designer and chief animation director.[11] While Takeshi Abo, the composer for the Science Adventure games, only had a small role in the previous anime adaptation of the series, he was appointed to compose for the Steins;Gate anime together with his coworker Jun Murakami. Abo composed new music, and made use of the same atmosphere and musical worldview as when he composed for the Steins;Gate game, but also had to consider that the music had to be synchronized with the motions of the anime; this was a very different way of working than the one he uses when composing for games.[12] The anime series has also received an animated film sequel, Steins;Gate: The Movie − Load Region of Déjà Vu, which premiered on April 20, 2013,[13] and an anime adaptation of Steins;Gate 0 premiered in 2018.[14] Footage from the Steins;Gate anime is used in the 2018 game Steins;Gate Elite – a fully animated, updated version of the original Steins;Gate game – along with new animation by White Fox.[15][16]<br></p>', 'the-door-to-the-steins-emerges', '9anime-1675083038.png', '2023-01-30 09:50:38', '2023-01-30 09:50:38'),

The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empire\'s conquest of Japan on August 10, 2010 a.t.b., by means of Britannia\'s newest weapon, the \"Autonomous Armored Knight\", or \"Knightmare Frame\". In turn, Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area 11 with its citizens referred to as Elevens. The point of divergence for this timeline appears to be that King Henry VIII of England had a male heir who became King Henry IX. Later, England, led by Queen Elizabeth III, was defeated by Napoleon at the Battle of Trafalgar. The queen fled to Britain\'s North American colonies where the Britannian Empire was established.</p><hr><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Lelouch vi Britannia is an exiled Britannian prince, son of Emperor Charles zi Britannia and his royal consort Marianne vi Britannia. Lelouch has a sister, Nunnally vi Britannia. Marianne was brutally murdered in the palace and Nunnally, who witnessed the murder of their mother, was so traumatized she lost both her sight and ability to walk. Lelouch is furious with his father, believing his father failed his mother and sister by turning a blind eye to their mother\'s death and failing to pursue their mother\'s killer. Lelouch and Nunnally are sent as political pawns to Japan to lull the Japanese government into a false sense of security. After the siblings are sent to Japan, Japan is attacked and defeated by Britannia. With the ruins of Japan as a background, Lelouch vows to his Japanese friend Suzaku Kururugi that he will one day obliterate Britannia as an act of vengeance against his father. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Seven years later, Lelouch (now going by the name Lelouch Lamperouge), is now a popular yet withdrawn student at Ashford Academy. Lelouch becomes involved in a terrorist attack and finds a mysterious girl called C.C.

This power, also known as the \"Power of Kings\" (王の力, Ō no Chikara), allows him to command anyone to do whatever he wants, including bending their will to live, fight, or die on his behalf. This power can affect an individual just once and only through direct eye contact. Lelouch decides to use his Geass to find his mother\'s murderers, destroy the Britannian Empire, and create a better world where Nunnally can live happily. In the process, Lelouch becomes Zero, a masked vigilante and the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights, gaining popularity and support among the Japanese on his way towards the rebellion of Britannia. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">However, this does not come without a cost.

The town surrounds a strange, giant hole descending deep into the earth, which is known as the Abyss. The Abyss harbors artifacts and remnants of civilizations long gone, and is, therefore, a popular hunting spot for so-called Cave Raiders, who undertake arduous and dangerous descents into the mist-filled pit to recover whatever relics they can find. Returning from the Abyss can be dangerous as \"the Curse of the Abyss,\" a mysterious and potentially fatal malady, manifests upon ascension. The deeper one goes, the more acute the effects of the curse; few who have descended into the lower regions have returned to tell of their experiences.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Some legendary Cave Raiders earn the title of White Whistles, one of them being Riko\'s mother, Lyza, who is presumed dead after taking a \"last descent\" into the Abyss.

One day, she discovers a half-human/half-robot boy in the first layer of the Abyss and names him Reg (after a dog that Riko owned). Riko and her friends sneak Reg into Belchero and quickly welcome him into their close-knit group. Sometime later, a number of findings are made from the depths of the Abyss, including Lyza’s White Whistle and pages of discoveries and observations she had made, as well as a message presumably for Riko, stating she is waiting at the bottom of the Abyss. Riko, determined to find her mother, bids farewell to her friends and secretly departs into the Abyss with Reg as her companion.<br></p>', 'riko-descends-into-the-abyss', '9anime-1675083554.jpg', '2023-01-30 09:59:14', '2023-01-30 09:59:14');
